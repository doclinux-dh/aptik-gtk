## Aptik GTK

Aptik GTK is a GTK frontend for the [Aptik System Migration Utility](https://github.com/teejee2008/aptik).

Aptik is a tool for **migrating settings and data** from one Linux installation to another. It can be used while re-installing the operating system, and when moving to next release of a Linux distribution.
